# Strings Manipulation

## Task Description

Your task is to create a Python script named `host_check.py` that extracts the host from a given text string. The text string will be in the format of an email, and you need to extract the host part.

### Rules

1. The input text will always be in the format 'From [email] [other information]'. Example: 'From mehak@sines.nust.edu.pk Sat Nov 5 09:14:16 2023'
2. Extract the host part from the email address.
3. Save the extracted host in a variable named `host`.
4. Print the `host` variable.

## Submission
Submit a file named host_check.py containing your Python script.

### Autograding
The autograder will run your script with different inputs to ensure it correctly extracts the host. Make sure your script follows the specified rules.

## Note
 Do not explain the code in the file; the autograder will evaluate it based on its functionality.

Good luck!
